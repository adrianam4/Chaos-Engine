## Introduction

An amazing Engine created by three university students from CITM-UPC for the subject Game Engines. 
With this engine you can create and transform 3D objects and your imported FBX, load textures and much more!
With the last release you can now include UI Components, such as Buutons, Sliders, Input Boxes, Images and Checkboxes!
